# Project-BTTV

#### Project Title: 
What factors or lifestyles attribute to cancer cases/rates throughout the country?


#### Team Members:   
Belinda – Trevor – Tawny – Valerie


#### Project Description/Outline:
-Cancer death rates by state with:    
-Smoker data     
-Alcohol data  
-Obesity data 
-Additional demographics:
  -By gender.   
  -By race.   
  -By age.    
  -By income.     

#### Research Questions to Answer:  
*What is the relation of cancer death to smoking rates?  
*What is the relation of cancer death to alcohol binge drinking?  
*What is the relation of cancer death to obesity?  
*What is the relation of cancer death to additional demographics including income?  
*Any other special considerations or discoveries made.  

#### Datasets to be Used: 
*CDC - National Center for Health Statistics – CSV/Excel.  
*CDC - United States Cancer Statistics – CSV/Excel.  
*CDC – Map of Cigarette Use Among Adults – CSV/Excel.   
Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results Program (SEER).   
*Census Data – CSV/Excel/API.  

#### Data Visualizations:
-Bar plot on Top 5 cancer deaths by state.  
-Pie plot on Male vs Female cancer death rate.  
-Cancer deaths vs Smoking.  
-Cancer deaths vs Alcohol consumption.  
-Cancer deaths vs Obesity.  
-Cancer deaths vs Additional demographics (including income).  
-Heat map.  
-Pearson correlation.  

#### Rough Breakdown of Tasks:
-ALL – read in data.   
-Trevor – Smoking Stuff.   
-Val – Obesity.  
-Belinda – Alcohol.   
-Tawny – Demographics (including income, insurance, gender).  

#### Breakdown of presentation: (**SEE BREAKDOWN.MD**)
*Intro – introduce the topic.  
*Something difficult – share something difficult with data visualization.  
*Something interesting or surprising – share something interesting with data visualization.  
*Summary – summarize the topic with mention of (interventions or treatment).  


#### Special Considerations:
*Make sure we can read in the data.  
*Look into possibly binning income and age.
