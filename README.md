# Project-BTTV

#### Project Title: 
Compare state with lowest cancer rate and state highest cancer rate


#### Team Members:   
Belinda – Trevor – Tawny – Valerie


#### Project Description/Outline:
Cancer rates and survivability	 - Compare with smoker data
	-By state
	-By year
	-By gender
	-By race
	-By age
	-By income

#### Research Questions to Answer:
What are the total number of cancer cases in the United States?
What is the survivability rate by state?
Comparison across 3 or more years?
What 3 types of cancer are most prevalent (by state)?
By gender? By race? By age? By income?
What stage cancer is typically discovered?
Interventions or treatments by region or state (specialized trials)?

#### Datasets to be Used: 
*CDC - National Center for Health Statistics – CSV/Excel
*CDC - United States Cancer Statistics – CSV/Excel
*CDC – Map of Cigarette Use Among Adults – CSV/Excel
Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results Program (SEER)
*Census Data – CSV/Excel/API

#### Data Visualizations:
Cancer Rates by States – Heat Map
Compare Highest with Lowest (Emphasize East vs West) – Bar 
By Gender – Pie
By Race – Line
By Age – Bar
Income / Healthcare rates - Scatter
Time period – Trend analysis how changed over time double line graph
Smoking / Cancer Rate – Scatter
Survivability – Heat Map
Interventions & Treatment  - Bar

#### Rough Breakdown of Tasks:
ALL – read in data
Trevor – Smoking Stuff
Val – Time Period and Survivability
Belinda – Compare highest and lowest
Tawny – Python may be a strength, 

##### Breakdown of presentation:
Intro – introduce the topic.
Something difficult – share something difficult with data visualization. 
Something interesting or surprising – share something interesting with data visualization.
Summary – summarize the topic with mention of (interventions or treatment).


#### Special Considerations:
*Make sure we can read in the data
*Look into possibly binning income and age
